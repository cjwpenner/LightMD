# Commercial License

## Overview

LightMD is licensed under GPLv3 for open-source use. If you wish to use LightMD in a commercial, proprietary, or closed-source product without the requirements of GPLv3, a commercial license is available.

## Why a Commercial License?

The GPLv3 license requires that any derivative works or software that incorporates LightMD must also be released under GPLv3. This means:

- Your source code must be made publicly available
- Any modifications must be shared under the same license
- End users must be granted the same freedoms

If these requirements don't align with your business model, a commercial license allows you to:

- Use LightMD in proprietary/closed-source applications
- Distribute LightMD without source code disclosure requirements
- Modify LightMD without releasing your changes
- Integrate LightMD into commercial products

## Commercial License Terms

Commercial licenses are negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on:

- Scope of use (single product, multiple products, enterprise-wide)
- Distribution model (internal use, SaaS, redistributable software)
- Number of developers/seats
- Support and maintenance requirements
