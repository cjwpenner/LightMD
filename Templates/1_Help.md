## Quick Start

### 1. Using Templates
The **Templates** menu provides pre-built templates for common use cases:
- **Agent**: AI agent system prompts and instructions
- **PRD**: Prompt Requirements Documents
- **CodeReview**: Structured code review guidelines
- **DataAnalysis**: Data analysis instruction frameworks
- **APIDocumentation**: API documentation templates
- **TestPlan**: Testing strategy templates
- **TechnicalSpec**: Technical specification documents
- **UserStory**: Agile user stories with acceptance criteria
- **BugReport**: Bug documentation templates
- **MeetingSummary**: Meeting notes with action items
- **ResearchSummary**: Research findings and insights
- **RefactoringPlan**: Code refactoring strategy

**To use a template:**
1. Click **Templates** in the menu bar
2. Select your desired template
3. The template loads as a new unsaved document
4. Customize it for your needs and save with a new filename

### 2. Working with Variables

Variables are placeholders in your document that can be dynamically replaced. LightMD automatically detects and tracks them.

**Variable Format:** `{{variable_name}}`

**Rules for Variables:**
- Must be enclosed in double curly braces: `{{}}`
- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-insensitive: use any naming style you prefer

**Valid Examples:**
- `{{USER_NAME}}` - all caps (traditional style)
- `{{userName}}` - camelCase
- `{{user_name}}` - snake_case
- `{{apiKey123}}` - with numbers
- `{{_privateVar}}` - starting with underscore

**Invalid Examples:**
- `{{123user}}` - can't start with a number
- `{{user name}}` - no spaces allowed
- `{{user-name}}` - no hyphens allowed

**Variable Sidebar:**
- All detected variables appear in the right sidebar
- Variables are automatically sorted alphabetically
- Double-click any variable to insert it at your cursor position
- Great for maintaining consistency across your document

### 3. AI Assistant

The built-in AI assistant helps you create, edit, and improve your documents.

**Initial Setup:**
1. Click **"Configure API Key"** button in the AI Assistant panel (bottom right)
2. Enter your Anthropic API key
   - Get a key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Your key is stored locally in `lightmd_config.json`
3. Choose your model from the dropdown:
   - **Haiku 4.5**: Faster, cost-effective for quick tasks
   - **Sonnet 4.5**: More capable, better for complex documents

**What the AI Assistant Knows:**
- **About LightMD**: The AI understands it's helping you use a markdown editor designed for AI instruction documents

## Creating Your Own Templates

Want to add custom templates?

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `Templates` folder
2. Name it descriptively (e.g., `ChatbotPrompt.md`, `EmailTemplate.md`)
3. Add your template content with variables and structure
4. Restart LightMD or reopen the Templates menu
5. Your template appears automatically!

**Tips:**
- Start filenames with numbers to control sort order (e.g., `1_Help.md`, `2_MyTemplate.md`)
- Include metadata sections for consistency
- Use `{{VARIABLES}}` as placeholders
- Add comments to guide users

---

## Configuration

LightMD stores preferences in `lightmd_config.json`:
- Theme preference (light/dark)
- Anthropic API key (encrypted storage recommended in production)

---

## Troubleshooting

**AI Assistant not responding?**
- Check that you've configured your API key
- Verify your API key is valid at console.anthropic.com
- Check your internet connection

**Variables not highlighting?**
- Ensure double curly braces: `{{}}`
- Check that variables start with a letter or underscore
- Variables must not contain spaces or special characters

**Templates not appearing?**
- Verify `.md` files are in the `Templates` folder
- Restart LightMD to refresh the template list

**Spell check highlighting too aggressive?**
- This is normal - it highlights any non-dictionary words
- Technical terms and acronyms may be flagged
- Variables should be automatically excluded

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Quick Variable Reuse**: Double-click variables in the sidebar to insert them instantly

2. **Chat Context**: The AI remembers your conversation, so you can refine iteratively
   - "Now make it more concise"
   - "Add error handling to that section"

3. **Template Customization**: Load a template, customize it, then save as your own template file

4. **Version Control**: Save your documents in a git repository to track changes over time

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn the shortcuts - they make editing much faster

6. **AI Model Selection**:
   - Use **Haiku 4.5** for quick questions and simple edits
